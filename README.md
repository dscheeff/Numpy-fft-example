# Numpy-fft-example
Example code to use Fourier transform, numpy.fft()


The Fourier transform allows us to change a signal from time domain to frequiency domain.  In other words a time based signal is transformed to show frequency components.  In the case of an audio signal, you might imagine a sound wave graph with time for the X axis and volume for the Y axis.  The output of the Fourier transform would show the tones present in the signal.  


This code is a simple example showing the following with plots: 
  1. Creation of serveral sine waves 
  2. Creation of a "signal" wave as the sum of the sine waves
  3. Fourier transform of the signal showing the frequency components
